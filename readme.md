# Realtime chat

This application is a simple realtime chat that uses Socket.IO.

Its only purpose is to learn how to use Socket.IO and to build a first application using Vue.

> As of now, the Vue application hasn't been developed. The back-end application exposes a simple [HTML page](./realtime-chat-back/index.html) which imports Socket.IO to test communication with the server.
